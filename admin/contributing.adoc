== Contributing

To contribute to this organisation, you can submit your Project's informations or the code in order to create a new Git project to host it. You can also keep & maintain your project separately.
In both cases, here are the information required :

* Name of the project,
* Description,
* Technology involved : Language used, Domain (Middleware, mobile, ...)
* Tags : categories, keywords describing the project
* Owner : Author or main contributor of the project
* Link to the git repository (github, bitbucket, ...) - optional

Of course, there are plenty of things to do around the documentation and we will appreciate a lot if you enrich the patterns, vocabulary, concepts, quickstarts, ...

The Microservices Team !
